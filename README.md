# Data Visualization Project

## Visualization Project

This repository has been created for a project in the data visualization course of the data science study program at the university of applied sciences in Kiel. The project is about getting interesting insights from visualizing data.

The data that is visualized in this repository contains different attributes of traffic stops the state patrol made in the US states of california and texas between the years 2013 and 2015. The goal is to spot similarities and differences between these two states that are different for example in the strength of political parties or the density of population. Yet they both share a border to their neighboring country mexico.

## Files in this Repository

There are a few files in this repository, that are explained here:

- **README**: The Read Me file to this repository
- **READ-ME-DATA**: The Read Me file for the data, in which all columns and specialities of different states are explained. This is provided by the Stanford Open Policing Project.
- **Data_preprocessing**: The markdown and html file that contains the code and explanations for the steps taken to get from the raw data to the clean data.
- **Data_Visualization_Project**: The markdown and html file that contains the code and explanations for the visualizations and its findings.

As the files that contain the data sets are too large for this repository, they can't be found here. If you want to run this code yourself, you need to download the data first. You can do that on the website from the Stanford Open Policing Project (the link is provided in the next section) or from Kaggle. I chose to download from Kaggle, because there you can find smaller excerpts of the data. 
Please go to the following links for the download and be aware that I renamed the files, so that you do not run in to problems when trying to reproduce my results:

- [Texas](https://www.kaggle.com/stanford-open-policing/stanford-open-policing-project-texas)


## Stanford Open Policing Project

The data used to provide the visualizations is an excerpt from the Stanford Open Policing Project.
This project gathers and analyzes data of traffic stops from nearly all states of the USA.
The excerpt used in this repository shows data of traffic stops from state patrol in california and texas.
